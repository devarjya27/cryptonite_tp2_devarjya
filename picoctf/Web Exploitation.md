# Forbidden Paths
**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

## My Solve
The challenge was simple and the solution was given in the challenge description. 

In the web page we can see that we can input a file and read that by clicking the read button. Our goal is to read `flag.txt` and the challenge clearly mentions that absolute paths wont work thus we need to use relative paths.

We know that `.` refers to our current working directory and `..` refers to the parent directory. The web page lives in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` thus we can access `flag.txt` like this `../../../flag.txt`. Each `..` goes back to the previous directory.

Thus our solution will look something like this:

And voila we get our flag:

### Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As the solution was very simple I got the flag on my first few tries.

### What I Learned
I got better clarity on the concept of `relative paths`.

# Cookies

## My Solve
The web page looks something like this

its clear from the name of the challenge that some modifications are to be done in the cookies tab after pressing `ctrl+shift+i` to get to the solution.
* Firstly I checked the cookies tab and we can see that a cookie `name` has a value of `-1`.

* I thought changing the value will give us a lead. And voila it did, changing the value to `0` made the web page look something like this:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ebaa81-a2cc-4de3-bdf7-1f5bd12501d4)

* Now changing the value to `1`, the web page now looks something like this:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3744ca27-96e0-489a-a60d-18a9ca757378)

* I kept incrementing the value of `name` by 1 until i finally got the flag at value `18`

## Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As the challenge was fairly simple I was always on the right track. At a certain point i thought i was doing something wrong as incrementing the value of `name` by 1 till 18 seemed tedious so I kind of got sidetracked and started looking at other things in the Inspect window but finally got the flag.

## What I Learned
A similiar challenge was given in OASIS where we had to set the value of `admin` as `True` in the cookies tab. I forget the name of the achallenge but as i already had an idea of how to utilize and modify the cookies tab the challenge seemed easy.
