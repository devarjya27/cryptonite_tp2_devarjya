# Forbidden Paths
**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

## My Solve
The challenge was simple and the solution was given in the challenge description. 

In the web page we can see that we can input a file and read that by clicking the read button. Our goal is to read `flag.txt` and the challenge clearly mentions that absolute paths wont work thus we need to use relative paths.

We know that `.` refers to our current working directory and `..` refers to the parent directory. The web page lives in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` thus we can access `flag.txt` like this `../../../flag.txt`. Each `..` goes back to the previous directory.

Thus our solution will look something like this:

And voila we get our flag:

### Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As the solution was very simple I got the flag on my first few tries.

### What I Learned
I got better clarity on the concept of `relative paths`.
