# Forbidden Paths
**Flag:** `picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_e5fe3d4d}`

## My Solve
The challenge was simple and the solution was given in the challenge description. 

In the web page we can see that we can input a file and read that by clicking the read button. Our goal is to read `flag.txt` and the challenge clearly mentions that absolute paths wont work thus we need to use relative paths.

We know that `.` refers to our current working directory and `..` refers to the parent directory. The web page lives in `/usr/share/nginx/html/` thus we can access `flag.txt` like this `../../../flag.txt`. Each `..` goes back to the previous directory.

Thus our solution will look something like this:

And voila we get our flag:

### Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As the solution was very simple I got the flag on my first few tries.

### What I Learned
I got better clarity on the concept of `relative paths`.

# Cookies

**Flag:** picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_064663be}

## My Solve
The web page looks something like this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4667dcd-8bbf-49ec-a49d-9234d030d0f4)


its clear from the name of the challenge that some modifications are to be done in the cookies tab after pressing `ctrl+shift+i` to get to the solution.
* Firstly I checked the cookies tab and we can see that a cookie `name` has a value of `-1`.

* I thought changing the value will give us a lead. And voila it did, changing the value to `0` made the web page look something like this:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16ebaa81-a2cc-4de3-bdf7-1f5bd12501d4)

* Now changing the value to `1`, the web page now looks something like this:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3744ca27-96e0-489a-a60d-18a9ca757378)

* I kept incrementing the value of `name` by 1 until i finally got the flag at value `18`

## Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As the challenge was fairly simple I was always on the right track. At a certain point i thought i was doing something wrong as incrementing the value of `name` by 1 till 18 seemed tedious so I kind of got sidetracked and started looking at other things in the Inspect window but finally got the flag.

## What I Learned
A similiar challenge was given in OASIS where we had to set the value of `admin` as `True` in the cookies tab. I forget the name of the achallenge but as i already had an idea of how to utilize and modify the cookies tab the challenge seemed easy.

# SOAP

**Flag:** picoCTF{XML_3xtern@l_3nt1t1ty_540f4f1e}

## My Solve
* Reading the hint for the challenge we can see that we need to use the concpet of XEE or XXE to get the flag. After reading a bit about XML external entity injections I learned that they give us access to unauthorized resources and files. As per the challenge we need to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
* In the web page, the only that gives us access to external resources or data is the `Details` button. Therefore inspecting that we can see that upon clicking the button it sends a xml request payload. Thus we need to modify this somehow to read the `/etc/passwd` file.

* `portswigger` had the solution on how to do a XXE injection. I simply copy pasted that and sent a POST request.

  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "/etc/passwd"> ]><data><ID>&xxe;</ID></data>
  ```
  * And voila we get the flag in the responses tab

## Incorrect Tangents I Went On
As i was trying to do a XXE injection, I was initially not getting responses. I figured that out that i was not getting `200 OK` response as i was connected to `iBus`. Changin my wifi allowed me to get a `200 OK` responses and I got the flag.

## What I Learned
I learned that XXE injection allows an attacker to interfere with the XML data of an application which can lead to the attacker being able to view sensitive file and content. We can prevent these sort of attacks by disabling the processing of external entities in our XML parser.
